we're really excited that you've taken the time to visit

What is rice-lb-extensions
=================

  Liquibase extensions proprietary to [Kuali Rice](http://rice.kuali.org) software. These are mostly custom refactorings that apply to
the [Kuali Rice](http://rice.kuali.org) platform. Here's an example of what we're talking about:

    <customChange class="org.liquibase.change.ext.CreateResponsiblityAttribute">
        <param name="value"          value="TA" />
        <param name="attributeDef"   value="documentTypeName" />    
        <param name="responsibility" value="Review" />
        <param name="namespace"      value="KFS-TEM" />
        <param name="type"           value="Document Type, Routing Node & Action Information" />
    </customChange>
